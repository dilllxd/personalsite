# Dylan's Personal Site

Welcome to my website repository. This houses/hosts the code that powers my personal site.

## Recent Fixes (September 2025)

âœ… **All Issues Resolved:**

1. **Connection text formatting** - Fixed connecting state display with proper styling and message formatting
2. **Music position on refresh** - Fixed music position to show actual current position instead of starting at 0:00, added proper position tracking for refresh scenarios
3. **Comprehensive music updates** - Added real-time updates for:
   - Skip/reverse >5 seconds
   - Song changes
   - Pause/resume state changes
   - Proper position synchronization
4. **WebSocket connectivity** - Completed WebSocket conversion and fixed CORS issues that were preventing the website from connecting to the rpc.dylan.lol backend

The music widget now properly connects via WebSocket to the tidal-connection backend and provides real-time activity and music updates with smooth progress tracking.
